# Gauss-Jordan-Calculator
Gauss-Jordan Elimination program written in C Language that accepts a matrix input with NxN dimensions

The Gauss-Jordan Elimination method is an algorithm to solve a linear system of equations. We can also use it to find the inverse of an invertible matrix. The Gauss Jordan Elimination, or Gaussian Elimination, is an algorithm to solve a system of linear equations by representing it as an augmented matrix, reducing it using row operations, and expressing the system in reduced row-echelon form to find the values of the variables.

 A system of equations is a collection of two or more equations with the same set of unknown
variables that are considered simultaneously.
Ex: The following set of equations is a system of equations.
𝑥𝑥 − 2𝑦𝑦 + 3𝑧𝑧 = 9
−𝑥𝑥 + 3𝑦𝑦 = −4
2𝑥𝑥 − 5𝑦𝑦 + 5𝑧𝑧 = 17
Definition: An augmented matrix is a rectangular array of numbers that represents a system of equations.
Ex: Turn the following system of equations into an augmented matrix.
𝑥𝑥 − 2𝑦𝑦 + 3𝑧𝑧 = 9
−𝑥𝑥 + 3𝑦𝑦 = −4
2𝑥𝑥 − 5𝑦𝑦 + 5𝑧𝑧 = 17
